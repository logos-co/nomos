# Nomos

Nomos is the blockchain layer of the Logos technology stack, providing a privacy-preserving and censorship-resistant
framework for decentralized network states.

This monorepo serves as a unified codebase for the Nomos ecosystem, housing all core components, services, and tools
necessary for running and interacting with the Nomos blockchain. Key features include:

- Consensus mechanisms for secure and scalable network agreement
- Ledger management for state persistence and validation
- Networking layers leveraging libp2p for peer-to-peer communication
- CLI tools and clients for seamless interaction with the blockchain
- Testnet configurations for development and experimentation

## Design Goals

### Service Architecture

Nomos services follow a consistent design pattern: a front layer handles the `Overwatch` service, while a back layer
implements the actual service logic.

This modular approach allows for easy replacement of components in a declarative manner.

For example:

```rust ignore
#[derive(Services)]
struct MockPoolNode {
    logging: OpaqueServiceHandle<Logger>,
    network: OpaqueServiceHandle<NetworkService<Waku>>,
    mockpool: OpaqueServiceHandle<MempoolService<WakuAdapter<Tx>, MockPool<TxId, Tx>>>,
    http: OpaqueServiceHandle<HttpService<AxumBackend>>,
    bridges: OpaqueServiceHandle<HttpBridgeService>,
}
```

### Static Dispatching

Nomos favours static dispatching over dynamic, influenced by Overwatch.
This means you'll encounter Generics sprinkled throughout the codebase.
While it might occasionally feel a bit over the top, it brings some solid advantages, such as:

- Compile-time type checking
- Highly modular and adaptable applications

## Development Workflow

### Docker

#### Building the Image

To build the Nomos Docker image, run:

```bash
docker build -t nomos .
```

#### Running a Nomos Node

To run a docker container with the Nomos node you need to mount both `config.yml` and `global_params_path` specified in
the configuration.

```bash
docker run -v "/path/to/config.yml" -v "/path/to/global_params:global/params/path" nomos /etc/nomos/config.yml
```

To use an example configuration located at `nodes/nomos-node/config.yaml`, first run the test that generates the random
kzgrs file and then run the docker container with the appropriate config and global params:

```bash
cargo test --package kzgrs-backend write_random_kzgrs_params_to_file -- --ignored

docker run -v "$(pwd)/nodes/nomos-node/config.yaml:/etc/nomos/config.yml" -v "$(pwd)/nomos-da/kzgrs-backend/kzgrs_test_params:/app/tests/kzgrs/kzgrs_test_params" nomos /etc/nomos/config.yml

```

## Running Tests

To run the test suite, use:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Generating Documentation

To generate the project documentation locally, run:

```bash
cargo doc
```
