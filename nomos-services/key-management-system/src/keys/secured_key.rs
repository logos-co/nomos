/// The input data in [`TargetEncoding`] is first converted to the key's native
/// encoding, then signed using the key and, finally, the signature is converted

/// - [`TargetEncoding`]: The alternative encoding type, which must implement
///   [`Encoding`].
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// let signature = key.sign_adapted(adapted_data)?;
/// ```
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns a [`KeyError`] if the conversion or signing fails.
