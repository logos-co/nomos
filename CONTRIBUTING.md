## Running Pre-Commit Hooks

To ensure consistent code quality, we ask that you run the `pre-commit` hooks before making a commit.

These hooks help catch common issues early and applies common code style rules, making the review process smoother for
everyone.

1. Install the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) tool if you haven't already:

```bash
# On Fedora
sudo dnf install pre-commit

# On other systems
pip install pre-commit
```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

3. That's it! The pre-commit hooks will now run automatically when you make a commit.
