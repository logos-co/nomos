[toolchain]
# Keep this version in sync also in the following places:
# * Dockerfile
# * shell.nix
# * ci/Dockerfile
# * testnet/Dockerfile
# * testnet/Dockerfile.debug
# Also, update the version of the nightly toolchain to the latest nightly of the new version specified in the following places:
# * workflows/code-check.yml (fmt job)
# * .pre-commit-config.yml (fmt hook)
# Then, if there is any new allow-by-default rustc lint introduced/stabilized, and if the new lint is to be enforced, add it to the respective entry in our `config.toml`.
channel = "1.87.0"
# Even if clippy should be included in the default profile, in some cases it is not installed. So we force it with an explicit declaration.
