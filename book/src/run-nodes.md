# Run Nomos Nodes

This section provides instructions to configure and run multiple Nomos nodes.
You should read with the [Installation](../installation/installation.md) section before proceeding.

## Configuration

A Nomos node is configured using a configuration file (YAML).
If you are running a node using the Docker image, the config file is contained in the image (`/etc/nomos/config.yml`).
