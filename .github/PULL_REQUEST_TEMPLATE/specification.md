## 1. What does this PR implement?

> [!NOTE]  
> Review  
>
the [Specification to Implementation Process document](https://www.notion.so/Specification-to-Implementation-Process-0cd6547233fa43a1a03d6e360de9eb2b).

## 2. Does the code have enough context to be clearly understood?

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Add a link to the specification document, pointing at the specific section.  
> Any implementation detail that could be considered idiosyncratic and not direct from the specification, should be  
> explained.  
> Always consider what someone new would need to know for the code to make sense, and add this context to it.

## 3. Who are the specification authors and who is accountable for this PR?

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Ping the original specification author(s) and add them as reviewers, alongside any other from the engineering team.  
> You are accountable for the PR and its rapid resolution, so make sure anyone involved is aware and actively
> advancing  
> the review.

## 4. Is the specification accurate and complete?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * If not, engage in a conversation directly with the authors, prompting any updates in the document.
> * You are accountable of this process, and the specification author needs to give priority to unblocking you.

## 5. Does the implementation introduce changes in the specification?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Contact the specification author(s) and engage in the necessary conversation to agree on the proposed  
    modification/solutions.
> * Ensure the new changes are on par with the implementation at the end of the process.
> * The PR should not be merged until parity between implementation and specifications has been reached.
